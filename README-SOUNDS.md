# Sound Effects Instructions

Since your browser doesn't support the sound generation functionality, I've created a simpler approach to get the sound effects for your game.

## Method 1: Download from the Sound Page (Recommended)

1. Open the `sounds.html` file in your web browser.
2. This page contains several pre-selected sound effects that are perfect for your game's UI.
3. You can:
   - Preview each sound by clicking the play button
   - Download individual sounds by clicking their download buttons
   - Download all sounds at once using the "Download All Sounds" button

4. After downloading, place all the sound files in your `sounds` directory.

## Method 2: Find Your Own Sounds

If you prefer to find your own sound effects:

1. Visit free sound effect websites such as:
   - [SoundBible](https://soundbible.com/)
   - [FreeSound](https://freesound.org/)
   - [ZapSplat](https://www.zapsplat.com/)

2. Look for sci-fi UI sounds with these characteristics:
   - `ui_hover.mp3` - A short, subtle click (50-100ms)
   - `ui_click.mp3` - A digital click sound (100-150ms)
   - `ui_select.mp3` - A positive/affirmative beep
   - `ui_back.mp3` - A negative/declining beep
   - `ui_error.mp3` - An error sound

3. Name your downloaded sounds exactly as listed above and place them in your `sounds` directory.

## Using the Sounds in Your Game

Your game is already set up to use these sounds! The code in `sounds.js` handles all the sound playback for UI interactions.

Once you have the sound files in the correct location, you should hear:
- Hover sounds when moving over buttons and menu items
- Click sounds when pressing buttons
- Select sounds when choosing items or screens
- Other sounds for specific interactions

## Troubleshooting

- **No Sound Playing**: Make sure the sound files are named correctly and in the `sounds` directory.
- **Sound is Too Loud/Quiet**: You can adjust volume levels in the `sounds.js` file.
- **Wrong Sound Playing**: Check that the file names match what's expected in the code.

Enjoy your new game sounds!
