WIRES WIRES WIRES MAN, DO THE WIRES TODAY

THE BELOW CHANGES AND NOTES ARE TO BE IGNORED FOR NOW:

IGNORE: Add missions and steps to unlock new areas. 99% of them should be locked by default.
IGNORE: Add area sort options in addition to search bar. Sort by level, area biome type, recently unlocked, alphabetical. Other ideas?

IGNORE: Indicator for "True Max Level" (8) on passive skills. Max level by allocating passive points is 4, this can be over-leveled up to 8 with equipment.

IGNORE: TECH BLUEPRINTS. These will be permanently held blueprints you can USE to add to your fabrication window forever. There will be a blueprint book showing which one's you've gathered.
The way these work is simple, some items will require a blueprint. Once one is added, you can now make that item a limited number of times before the blueprint wears out (say, 5?). 
This adds chase to crafting, while make some drops more exciting because they are rarer but multi-use

IGNORE: Look closer at "viral" mechanic. Currently it doesn't do much.

IGNORE: change gear generation to have some more randomness to it

IGNORE: Interactive tutorial to show how to equip/unequip items etc

IGNORE: design new passives

IGNORE: medtek and injector implementation - they should now last for 1 delve each, instead of a timeframe. There will be a dialogue on the delve screen that you
IGNORE: click to select an injector. Multiple injectors at a time? Probably just 1. They can be more powerful/interesting if it's only 1.
IGNORE: Account Upgrade Purchaseable: Injectors last 1/2/3 (per tier purchased) more Delves 

IGNORE: ship implementation

IGNORE: MOST IMPORTANT: get progression started. What should a level 1 weapon look like? What should a basic level 51 (endgame) weapon look like?
IGNORE: What should peak endgame weapons look like? These are important things to work out.

THIS CONCLUDES THE TO-BE-IGNORED CHANGES AND NOTES
